Experiments with timing and behavior of various ways to get the os
environment from one process to another on the same host.

The use case is that an script or executable is invoked repeatedly by a third-
party program that passes information by setting environment variables, and the
script needs to relay that environment information to one or more
possibly long-lived processes on the same host that will process the
information and react accordingly. The options that are explored here
are using a named pipe, using a unix domain socket, using redis pub/sub, and
using a redis list as a queue.
